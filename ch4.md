# Dynamic Programming - An Outline

* Lots of math discussing *Problem `P(s)`* and its decomposition *Problem `P(1,s)`*.

* Dynamic programming's decomposition scheme is _Markovian_.

* Bellman's *Principle of Optimality*, equivalent to the *Markovian Condition*.

* Two central mathematical constructs:
    - the multistage decision model
    - the decomposition scheme
