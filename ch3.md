1. A sequence consisting of elements denoting the stages of the decision-making process.
2. A set whose elements represent the state of the process in each stage.
3. A collection of sets where each set contains elements designating the feasible decisions pertaining to a stage-state pair.
4. A transition function embodying the dynamics of the states as they evolve over stages.
5. An objective function stipulating the overall return or cost generated by any sequence of decisions.
