# Fundamentals

* What is DP?
    - A *sequential* of *multistage decision-making* model.
    - Embed, Derive, Solve, Recover.
    - _Any_ optimization problem that leads itself to a formulation that yields an equation known as the *dynamic progamming functional equation*, also the *dynamic programming optimalit equation*, and *Bellman's equation*.
    - The equations from `(2.2)` to `(2.8)`: how *dynamic programming optimality equation* is derived.

* Lots of math...

* *systematic enumeration* of all the feasible solutions pertaining to the problem.
